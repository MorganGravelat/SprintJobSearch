## Primitive Data Types

#Print a string and index that string
print ("Hello"[0])
print("123" + "345")

#Type of data in python # this means it prints out to be this
num_char = 1
print(type(num_char)) # <class 'int'>


#Convert num_char to string
new_num_char = str(num_char) #Conver to string

#Can be used now in a concat print statement
print('HEY FOOL' + new_num_char) #type(new_num_char) <class 'str'>

# Add two numbers from a two digit input number
def twoNumbers(num):
    new_num = int(num[0]) + int(num[1]) # Converting the indexed str to int
    return new_num
print(twoNumbers(two_digit_number))


##Mathematical Operators

#Addition
num1 = 3 + 5 #8

#Subtraction
num2 = 5 - 3 #2

#Multiplication
num3 = 5 * 2 #10

#Divison
num4 = 6 / 3 #2.0
# Division always prints out float even with no remainder

#Exponent
2 ** 2 # 4
#This is 2 to the power of 2

# Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally PEMDAS
# ()
# **
# * /    #With these two the most left will be selected first
# + -


## Body Mass Index BMI Code

height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")

def bodyindex(h, w):
    bmi = float(w) / (float(h)**2) #Input becomes a string, use float() to convert
    print(f"{w} รท ({h} x {h}) = {bmi}") #String formatting
    return bmi

print(bodyindex(height, weight))


##Number Manipulation
print (8/3) # 2.66666666
print (int(8/3)) # 2 #Convert into Integer int integer
print (round(8/3)) # 3 #2.6666666 UP Round number
print (round(8/3, 4)) # the 4 chooses the amount of decimal places you get NONE is 0

# You can take
result = 4 / 2 # 2
result /= 2 # this divides the result by 2 and makes it equal to the answer

# You can set a score
score = 0

score += 1 # 1 These can all manipulate the number.
score -= 1 # 0
score *= 1 # 0

## String Formatting
score = 0
height = 1.8
isWinning = True
# f-String
print(f"{score} that is score, then here is height {height} and here goes isWinning {isWinning}")
# Simple use of the f-String to calculate your days months and weeks until 90 years old
def weeksUntilNinety(age):
      years = 90 - int(age)
  months = round(years * 12)
  weeks = round(years * 52)
  days = round(years * 365)

  print(f"You have {days} days, {weeks} weeks, and {months} months left.")
  return f"You have {days} days, {weeks} weeks, and {months} months left."
